Caruso is one of the very best defenders on Planet Earth, but he turns 31 in February and will be up for a raise after this season. Chicago isn't nearly good enough to pencil in a semi-massive salary for a player entering the back end of his prime.</p><p>Signing him to a four-year, (estimated) $80 million extension wouldn't have been the end of the world. If anything, in the eyes of certain suitors, it would have increased his trade value down the line. But jettisoning him <i>could</i> suggest the Bulls understood that number isn't high enough to lock him down—or that he didn't want to stick around for their recurring bottom-of-the-middle pursuits.</p><p>Either way, relative to Chicago's outlook, the decision to trade Caruso is the correct one.</p><p>The timing? The actual return? They're both a special brand of awful. Hell, even the trade-announcement spin is utter dreck:</p>Will Gottlieb <span class=acct>@Will_Gottlieb</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"to replace Lonzo Ball" &lt;a href="https://t.co/ISjguZavVm">https://t.co/ISjguZavVm&lt;/a></p><p>Let's start with the actual return. While Caruso's departure implies some semblance of forward-thinking, accepting Giddey not only as the primary compensation but the entire kit and kaboodle reverses any trace of it.</p><p>Yes, he'll be 22 when the 2024-25 season tips off. But he was <i>just</i> rendered unplayable for stretches at a time in the postseason and, with one year left on his rookie scale, due for another, potentially (overly) expensive deal. The Bulls don't have a ton of time to decide how much he's worth. They may have to make that call before he ever sets foot on the floor.</p><p>Playing this out and letting him reach restricted free agency next summer isn't a particularly appealing alternative. Either Giddey underperforms, in which case the trade looks like a dud, or he exceeds expectations, in which case Chicago will be on the hook for bankrolling a massive deal at a time when it still won't have a distinct or coherent direction.</p><p>About that direction...I've lost count of how many times I've asked this question since 2015, but just what in the actual hell are the Bulls doing? Adding Giddey makes <i>zero</i> sense when they have Ayo Dosunmu, Coby White and Zach LaVine on the roster, all of whom are better than their new teammate.</p><p>This says nothing of Lonzo Ball, who <a href=# rel=noopener>might play next season</a>, but whose shooting and playmaking and defense the Bulls are looking to "replace" more than two years after his last appearance with a player who does exactly one of those things. Nor does it say anything of DeMar DeRozan, Chicago's best player and primary playmaker, who's getting set to enter unrestricted free agency.</p><p>Giddey was a shaky fit in Oklahoma City, on a team that runs exclusively four- and five-out lineups. He profiles as a horrendous fit alongside DeRozan and within a Bulls offense that ranked in the bottom five of both three-point-attempt rate (<a href=# rel=noopener>26th</a>) and efficiency (<a href=# rel=noopener>29th</a>) this past season.</p><p>Granted, there's still time for Chicago to remake itself to better align with its vision. But, like, this assumes they have one. This move leaves them more formless and directionless than they were before.</p><p>Spare us the "<i>This obviously signals they're rebuilding!</i>" propaganda if you're so inclined to carry Chicago's water. Teams gearing up for wholesale transitions don't prioritize players, however young, who are one year out from a (possibly) lucrative raise and don't come attached to any draft picks. And even if this is precursor to a more gradual timeline, it's still impossible to ignore the downside and blatant asset mismanagement:</p>Jason Patt <span class=acct>@Bulls_Jay</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Giddey isn't as bad as he was to close the year and if it leads to the Bulls just totally blowing it up it's a bit easier to stomach but it's horrendous asset management by the Bulls given Caruso's value, Giddey is 1 year from FA and at a low point, plus the off-court weirdness. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CORWYlwTry">https://t.co/CORWYlwTry&lt;/a></p><p>It would be one thing if the Bulls were the Toronto Raptors and this was their version of the OG Anunoby trade. For that to be true, though, they must have a No. 1 cornerstone in place (Scottie Barnes) and another player on the books they can move for even a modest first-round bounty (Pascal Siakam). They also need to be getting back someone who looks ready for a more expansive role and is worth the money he'll cost in his next deal (Immanuel Quickley).</p><p>Chicago is checking exactly <i>none</i> of these boxes.</p><p>That brings us to the timing. The Bulls <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly turned down</a> packages, plural, featuring multiple first-round picks ahead of the deadline. If this is the best offer currently out there, they waited too long to move a player everyone knew wasn't part of their long-term program. In the event executive vice president of basketball operations Artūras Karnišovas and his front office are actively choosing Giddey over proposals with first-round equity, well, the optics are even worse.</p><p>For anybody still holding out hope this transaction is a harbinger of starting over, I have another question: What does that even look like? Trading LaVine and/or Lonzo at the nadir of their markets? Letting DeRozan walk in free agency for absolutely nothing? Moving him in a sign-and-trade that invariably nets them less than they could have gotten if they shipped him out with actual time left on his contract?</p>Will Gottlieb <span class=acct>@Will_Gottlieb</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of the most notables details about the Caruso trade is they now can't attach him to dump LaVine&lt;br>&lt;br>Giddey deal doesn't give them any financial flexibility. Still need to move off Zach and they just severely limited their avenues to do so</p><p>None of this is meant to declare that the Bulls are acquiring a lost cause. Giddey can be a masterful passer, has great size and has put together semi-convincing stretches in which he knocks down open threes and keeps defenses on tilt with his floater. Pick-and-pops with Nikola Vučević could yield real value. (Never mind that a 33-year-old Vooch goes completely against the "But hey, maybe they're rebuilding!" grain.) Coby White's <a href=# rel=noopener>spot-up touch</a> also ensures the offensive dynamic between he and Giddey isn't a lost cause.</p><p>Still, if you find yourself touting the ability of your <i>most promising player</i> <i>to have the ball less</i> to justify the logic of a move, chances are you've messed up. For Chicago's part, this is something beyond that.</p><p>The Bulls are sending out a proven all-world defender for a singular, soon-to-be expensive maybe who likely requires a quasi-roster overhaul to have his skill set properly optimized and his weaknesses appropriately insulated.</p><p>This isn't akin to messing up, or a misguided stab in the dark, or even a morbidly opaque dice roll. This is franchise malpractice—yet another heaping, steaming pile of aimless B.S. the Bulls are shoveling down the throat of a fanbase that deserves better.</p><p><b>Oklahoma City Thunder: A++++++</b></p><img alt="OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA - NOVEMBER 22: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander #2 of the Oklahoma City Thunder attempts to drive past Alex Caruso #6 of the Chicago Bulls during the second half at Paycom Center on November 22, 2023 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The acquisition of Gordon Hayward at the trade deadline was opportunistic and low-stakes more than it was aggressive—and it didn't pan out.</p><p>This is different. Caruso is one of the league's most valuable defenders, someone who can capably, if not suffocatingly, guard four positions while wreaking havoc in passing lanes. Tossing him onto a roster that already has Lu Dort, Chet Holmgren, Cason Wallace, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams populating a defense that <a href=# rel=noopener>ranked fourth</a> in points allowed per possession is a nightmare development for 29 other teams.</p><p>The price Oklahoma City will pay to get Caruso renders this an overkill of genius.</p><p>Though the Thunder used a top-six pick on Giddey in 2021, their system has evolved beyond his skill set. SGA and J-Dub are ahead of him in their ball-handling ranks, and Wallace's defensive intensity and malleability already far outstrip anything Giddey can provide.</p>Stephen Dolan <span class=acct>@SteveThunderfan</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm just so happy Presti did a meaningful win-now move at this stage. Would've been so easy to be purely patient.&lt;br>&lt;br>But in a lot of ways, this is Jeff Green for Perk. Saw what was missing in the playoffs, traded a high pick who didn't fit perfectly for a vet role player.</p><p>To Giddey's credit, he made functional adjustments and strides over the past two years. They weren't enough. His spot inside Oklahoma City's most important lineups slumped beneath coin-toss territory long before the playoffs rolled around.</p><p>Moving him now is the prudent decision, not just functionally, but financially. Shelling out money for his next deal wouldn't have sat right with new contracts for SGA, J-Dub and Holmgren on the horizon.</p><p>Caruso could wind up being more affordable long-term. If he puts pen to paper on a four-year, (estimated) $80 million extension in six months, he will almost assuredly cost less than Giddey during that span—and, even at his age, be infinitely more tradeable.</p>Steph Noh <span class=acct>@StephNoh</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not many people were watching the Bulls over the past few years. People are about to see how ridiculous Caruso is.&lt;br>&lt;br>Bookmarking and RT-ing for when he creates multiple game-winning defensive plays out of thin air in the playoffs as he did like clockwork for the Bulls.</p><p>Landing Caruso will not address most of the offensive warts that befell the Thunder during their postseason jaunt. His downhill passing fits their systematic motif, and he just canned over 40 percent of his triples on a <a href=# rel=noopener>career-high 5.9 attempts per 36 minutes</a>. But he's not particularly high volume or someone who will put set defenses into rotation from a dead stop.</p><p>Yet Oklahoma City will give Caruso actual space with which to work. His live-dribble decision-making should look even better in the half-court, and the Thunder might be able to coax more scoring aggression out of him on drives, if only because he'll encounter less obstructed paths to the basket.</p><p>And, oh, yeah: They're not done, either.</p><p>Because the Bulls are the Bulls, this deal doesn't knife into OKC's limitless draft-pick stash. The Thunder are also taking on under $2 million in additional salary, which still leaves them with more projected cap space than any teams other than Detroit, Orlando, Philadelphia and <i>maaaybe</i> Charlotte, Toronto and Utah:</p>Keith Smith <span class=acct>@KeithSmithNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Thunder took on about $1.5M in salary in acquiring Alex Caruso for Josh Giddey.&lt;br>&lt;br>Oklahoma City should still be able to create $33.7M in cap space this summer.</p><p>Alarmists will worry about Caruso leaving in free agency, but Oklahoma City isn't making this deal without intel on his salary demands or interest in sticking around long-term. And even if the Thunder are going in blind, Caruso is worth the risk, and they're good enough and deep enough and flexible enough to withstand it.</p><p>Basically, this trade amounts to Oklahoma City acting like the championship contender it is—an earned, if perhaps overdue, departure from its usual conservatism that should terrify the ever living hell out of the entire league.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqCdX6MoKmanJmjtG6ty56vZpuRp8K0u4yjpqygXZy2pbDEsmStqpGZsm6uxK2unp2eYrCptcKanqhlkqq5rb%2BMqKKcZaSdwq%2BwxKs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nba-teams-with-the-toughest-paths-to-improvement-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NBA Teams with the Toughest Paths to Improvement | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriella-brooks-in-bathing-suit-had-best-summer-ever-celebwell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gabriella Brooks in Bathing Suit Had &amp;quot;Best Summer Ever&amp;quot; Celebwell</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
