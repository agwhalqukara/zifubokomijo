Many teams are struggling to piece together a reliable starting five, let alone being able to handle the inevitability of injuries. The collegiate ranks produce far fewer ready-made blockers because of practice and scheme limitations.</p><p>The incoming offensive line class should be a salve to heal some of the issues. The linemen in Mobile, Alabama, generated excitement about the overall talent and depth in the 2024 position class.</p><p>Even with the likes of Washington's <a href=#>Troy Fautanu</a>, Duke's <a href=#>Graham Barton</a>, Kansas State's <a href=#>Cooper Beebe</a> and West Virginia's <a href=#>Zach Frazier</a> (injury) opting out before the week began, the offensive linemen had the upper hand through most of the week. That's especially impressive because the Senior Bowl is geared toward the defensive line.</p><p>The highly anticipated one-on-ones favor athletic defenders who don't need to worry about an actual blocking scheme and help in protection. Continuity isn't a thing during only a handful of practices. Front-line defenders tend to dominate as result.</p><p>For the most part, they didn't during this year's festivities.</p><p>Jackson Powers-Johnson weighed in at 14 pounds heavier than his listed size at Oregon (320 pounds). During the first day of practice, he absolutely dominated. More importantly, Powers-Johnson showed he can be a similar player at guard, not just center.</p><p>Unfortunately, Powers-Johnson suffered a hamstring injury during the second day of practice and needed to pull out of the event. But he left Mobile as the clear top prospect in attendance.</p><p>Like his Pac-12 brethren, Oregon State's <a href=#>Taliese Fuaga</a> didn't practice on Thursday, though he remained dressed for the day. Fuaga is another potential first-round pick who looked the part, with strong hands and a relatively consistent pass set. Some more athletic edge-rushers can give him trouble. However, his power is readily evident in both phases of the game.</p><p>Oklahoma's <a href=#>Tyler Guyton</a> also didn't finish the week. The 6'7", 328-pound blocker dominated the first day of practice. His performance on the second day wasn't as clean. However, his size, length, physicality and movement skills clearly portend a future first-round selection.</p><p>Among those who finished out the week, Texas' <a href=#>Christian Jones</a> may have been the most surprising. Jones entered the festivities as a well-known prospect after starting three years for the Longhorns. But the inconsistency seen with his technique throughout his collegiate career should have served as a detriment when facing the best in Mobile.</p><p>It didn't. Instead, his pass sets were mostly consistent. Jones used his length (34⅞-inch arms) and size (6'5", 318 lbs) to shut down most of his opponents. He had one of the most impressive performances as a result.</p><p>Elsewhere, Kansas' <a href=#>Dominick Puni</a> showed improvement taking transition snaps from offensive tackle to guard to center. Connecticut's <a href=#>Christian Haynes</a> impressed because of the strength seen in his grip. Once Haynes laid his hands on a defender, the reps were over. Arkansas center <a href=#>Beaux Limmer</a> battled throughout the week despite his linear frame and short arms (31½"). Houston's <a href=#>Patrick Paul</a> certainly looks the part, though he needs to refine his technique. Utah's Sataoa Laumea worked at guard for a significant portion of time. Washington's <a href=#>Roger Rosengarten</a> wasn't overwhelmed and excelled after entering the draft as a surprising underclassman.</p><p>A good offensive line class is never sexy, but it's the infusion of talent that NFL desperately needs right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGyEenyMa2drbF2js615w6uYn6xdl7aos8Ssq2avmaO7pr7SZpinnF2hvLSx0axkn6qfonq1tMRmqp6mmaS%2Fbq7OsKM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexander-skarsgard-s-girlfriend-age-family-ethnicity-hairstyle-height-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alexander Skarsgard's girlfriend: age, family, ethnicity, hairstyle, height, career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-lou-metzger-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Lou Metzger Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
