The actor said when one is not being real with themselves, it’s like living in captivity.</p><p>Trevor Jackson went on to say that Lil Nas X was setting a great example for other people who maybe are struggling to find the courage to reveal their sexual orientation. Trevor added it lets people all over the globe realize they can be whomever they want to be.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>just cuz i’m gay don’t mean i’m not straight</p><p>— nope (@LilNasX) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 1, 2019</a></p><p>As it was previously reported, ever since Lil Nas X came out, other rappers and producers have applauded him for doing so. Recently, reporters from TMZ caught the rapper, Irv Gotti, who said that times have changed a lot in the black community, moreover, in the hip-hop community as well.</p><p>Gotti said to the outlet that twenty or thirty years ago, the community’s reaction to him would’ve been a lot different, however, now, people are more accepting and understanding of the lives and experiences of others – a great thing for society.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lil Nas X released his track on SoundCloud earlier this year, the aforementioned “Old Town Road,” and it went viral. Initially, Billboard removed it from the country charts for being too hip-hop, however, after Billy Ray Cyrus got on board and sang a part of the introduction, they put the song back on the charts.</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekp7K3u9FmoZqbm6i8r3nPq5iiq5Woeq21y2almqtdrXqnu8ulprChnpx6qbXSZqqesKWWuW670aKcp6yRqbawuoyrnK%2BdnJbBqrvNZmlycGFufnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-murdaugh-s-bro-slams-top-lawyer-for-stealing-from-their-firm-reveals-his-opioid-addic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Murdaughs bro slams top lawyer for stealing from their firm &amp;amp; reveals his opioid addic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-dye-bio-age-height-net-worth-boyfriend-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Dye Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
