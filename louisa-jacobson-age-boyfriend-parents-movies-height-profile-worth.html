Meryl Streep is one of the most successful and highly celebrated triple <i>Academy Award</i>-winning actresses in Hollywood. She passed her skills along to her three daughters, Louisa, Grace, Mamie, and her son Henry Wolfe, who have all taken an interest in showbiz. While her daughters have all leaned towards the acting path, Henry Wolfe has chosen a musical route as a musician and songwriter. Their father, Don Gummer, is just as talented, focusing his skills in contemporary art as a distinguished sculptor.</p><p class=align-left>The young <a href=#>actress </a>and model is the youngest of her siblings, growing up in their $3-million family estate in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Gummer attended the exclusive <i>Poly Prep Country Day School </i>in Brooklyn, New York. She subsequently graduated from the prestigious Liberal Arts College in New York called '<i>Vassar College</i>' in 2013 with a degree in psychology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7348cdbc92684551.jpg><h3>Louisa Jacobson's modelling career</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Louisa Jacobson </a>discovered a passion for fashion early in life, and once she was signed by <i>IMG Models,</i> an international modelling agency located in New York City, she began pursuing a modelling career. As a result, she has partnered with various high-end fashion houses, including <i>Christian Dior </i>and <i>H&M</i>. She has also modelled for <a href=#>prestigious fashion magazines</a>, such as <i>Glamour</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>, to name a few.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/476ae69467a269f3.jpg><h3>Louisa Jacobson's movies</h3><p class=align-left>This young beauty followed in her mother's footsteps when she made her first on-screen appearance on <i>EastEnders</i> in 2001. Two years later, she got back to work in the comedy <i>The Orange Tree</i>, followed by the recurring role of 'Stella' in <i>The Sitcom Trials.</i></p><p class=align-left>Her first big-screen role was in <i>The Ultimate Truth</i> in 2004, after which she took several jobs as a voice actor for the <a href=#>video gaming industry.</a> You might recognise her in games such as <i>The <a href=#>Movies</a> </i>and<i> The Order: 1886</i>, receiving a nomination by <i>VOX</i> for '<i>Best Female Voiceover Performance</i>'.</p><p class=align-left>In 2019, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Louisa</a> played 'Trish Sparks', in <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gone Hollywood</a>,</i> which is set in the 1980s and follows the story of a group of talented agents in their rise to success. In another historical piece, this talented actress stars alongside Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon in her latest television series, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>The Gilded Age</i>.</a> This historical drama was written by Julian Fellowes and began shooting Rhode Island in February of 2021. It will air on <i>HBO</i>, but the specific release date has not yet been determined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9489417fe317541e.jpg><h3>Louisa Jacobson's wedding</h3><p class=align-left>Before you get ahead of yourself, we are not talking about an actual wedding, but rather a theatrical performance called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>The Members of the Wedding</i>.</a> This adaptation of Carson McCullers 1950's play sees Louisa Jacobson in the role of Janice, who gets married to the protagonist, Frankie Addams 'played by Tavi Gevinson. The storyline elegantly explored issues concerning gender, sexuality and race on the Main Stage at the <i>Williamstown Theatre Festival</i> in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c731acf6c6fb8bb2.jpg><p class=align-left>Louisa Jacobson may have been born with her bum in the butter, but she has worked hard to gain recognition as a respectable fashion model and Hollywood actress. She has to share the spotlight with her all-star family, a small price to pay for inheriting the incredibly talented genes of the infamous Meryl Streep. We look forward to watching Gummer in <i>HBO's </i>latest historical drama series, <i>The Gilded Age</i>, which should be released any day now.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:<a href=#> Kate Moss' net worth, age, children, spouse, agency, height, profiles</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Kate Moss </a>is a supermodel and entrepreneur from the United Kingdom.
