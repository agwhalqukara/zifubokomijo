This is so exciting.&nbsp;</b><b>Where were you when you heard the news?</b></p><p><span><strong>Christian J. Simon</strong>: “I was on my balcony with my dog trying to get some fresh air. Out of no where, I heard my mom and dad shouting my name. I came in wondering what was going on and they shared the awesome news! It was an unbelievable feeling!”</span></p><p><b>CS:&nbsp;</b><b>What was your first reaction? How does it feel to say you’ve&nbsp;</b><b>been nominated for an Emmy at such a young age?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “My first reaction? Disbelief! It felt so surreal. It’s such an honor to be nominated and for it to happen at 12 is unbelievable. I’ve always dreamt of this moment in my career and I couldn’t be more grateful.”</span></p><p><b>CS: </b><b>What would winning mean to you? And who would you thank in&nbsp;</b><b>your acceptance speech?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “Winning would mean the world to me, but I honestly already feel like a winner with just the nomination alone. It feels great to be recognized among such elite voice actors. I’d thank God, my parents, grandparents, team, and T.O.T.S. family.”</span></p><p><b>CS: You are on two Disney shows — TOTS and Sydney to the Max.&nbsp;</b><b>What do you love most about both?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “Both shows are great. I love recording VO for T.O.T.S. because Freddy is such a warm and lovable character. He loves the baby animals and gets so excited for the smallest things. The show teaches kids about friendship, family, and accepting each other’s differences. Shooting for Sydney is awesome because it tells such meaningful stories, but still manages to keep you laughing. I love playing Leo because he is the kind of friend that everyone needs in their lives. He is responsible, smart, loyal, and extremely funny!”</span></p><p><b>CS: Can you share what’s to come from Leo in upcoming “Sydney to&nbsp;</b><b>the Max” episodes?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “More shenanigans with his best friend. You’ll meet a close family member of his, see the bond between him and Mom Judy grow, and of course tons of moments that are sure to make you laugh and have a great time.”</span></p><p><b>CS: </b><b>How have you been staying busy in quarantine?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “I really took advantage of this off time to get some rest and enjoy time with my family. I’ve been doing my best to interact with fans online. I also started working on a couple of personal creative projects.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>CS: </b><b>What’s one thing you can’t wait to do once quarantine is over?</b></p><p><span><strong>CJS</strong>: “I just want to go out and be free! Movies, restaurants, hanging out… I also can’t wait to get back to set to start working on Season 3 of Sydney to the Max!”&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKNjsLC5jpyfq6GjqbaiuoyjZKyhnaS7br%2FAsqpmmpWeu6h5zaikoqaRqbKlecWoqWaZXZmuusDIppxmnZ2ixm610maYp2Wlo6%2BmuMierZqanJp6p7HEpaCnn12axaS41Kygr51f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ginnifer-goodwin-offered-up-husband-josh-dallas-sperm-to-a-friend-who-wanted-to-be-a-mom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ginnifer Goodwin Offered Up Husband Josh Dallas Sperm To A Friend Who Wanted To Be A Mom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bulls-complete-2024-offseason-blueprint-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bulls' Complete 2024 Offseason Blueprint | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
