On the September 14, 1985 edition of Championship Wrestling, Steamboat defeated Mr. Fuji, but after his victory he was attacked by Fuji’s protege Don Muraco, pitting Steamboat in a feud against Muraco and Fuji. During a televised episode of WWF Championship Wrestling, Steamboat and Muraco were scheduled for a match that never officially started after Muraco jumped Steamboat before the bell. Following the beat down, Muraco and Fuji then used Steamboat’s karate black belt to hang him outside the ring from the top rop before Steamboat was finally saved by Tito Santana and the Junkyard Dog. On the November 2 Saturday Night’s Main Event III, he defeated Fuji in a kung fu challenge. On the January 4, 1986 Saturday Night’s Main Event IV, his intense feud with Muraco ended after he and the JYD beat Muraco and Fuji in a tag team match.</p><p>In 1985, Steamboat was offered a contract by Vince McMahon and he joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Shortly after his debut (where he defeated Steve Lombardi on Championship Wrestling), Steamboat was given the gimmick of a babyface nicknamed “the Dragon”; Steamboat’s jacket-and-trunks attire was replaced by a keikogi and long tights. Steamboat’s mother is Japanese American, hence his Asian features which were crucial for his “Dragon” gimmick. Steamboat kept the nickname and gimmick for the remainder of his career.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ricky Steamboat height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Ricky <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1977, Steamboat entered the National Wrestling Alliance-sanctioned Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) (which ran under the concurrent brand names “Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling” and “Wide World Wrestling”—later “World Wide Wrestling”—as well as airing syndicated TV programs under those respective names), where he would remain for the next eight years of his career. Steamboat, who had been brought in by JCP booker George Scott on the recommendation of Wahoo McDaniel, was initially billed as a babyface protege of Wahoo, and barely spoke above whispers in interviews. Matching him with his brash young counterpart, Ric Flair, was a natural fit. Steamboat was doing an interview on the syndicated Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling when Flair, then Mid-Atlantic television champion, began goading him. Steamboat knocked Flair out with a backhand chop to set up a match between the two. Steamboat’s star-making performance came when he pinned Flair after a double thrust off the top rope to win the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship at WRAL studios in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p><p align=justify>Blood has been married five times. First to Maureen Powers from 1977 until divorce in 1980, he later married his second wife Debra in 1981, they divorced in 1985 after four years of marriage, Blood then married his third wife Bonny Hastings in 1985, together they have a son, Richard Jr. (born July 7, 1987), who is also a wrestler, their marriage ended in a divorce in 2003.

Steamboat lost the match by countout but after the match, Savage continued to assault him and injured Steamboat’s larynx (kayfabe) with the ring bell, beginning an angle between the two. On the January 3, 1987 Saturday Night’s Main Event IX, Steamboat returned from his injury and prevented Savage from attacking George Steele like he had done to Steamboat six weeks prior. At WrestleMania III, Steamboat defeated Savage for the Intercontinental Championship. The highly influential match was considered an instant classic by both fans and critics and was named 1987’s Match of the Year by both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ricky Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Wrestler</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Ricky Steamboat celebrates birthday on February 28 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Several weeks after winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Steamboat asked WWF owner Vince McMahon for some time off to be with his wife Bonnie, who was expecting the birth of their first son, Richard, Jr. This did not sit well with WWF management as he had been groomed to become a long-term champion. The decision was made by WWF management to punish Steamboat by having him initially drop the title to Butch Reed, but Reed did not show up that night, so he dropped to The Honky Tonk Man on the June 13 edition of Superstars; his son was born a month later. Steamboat came back in time for the Survivor Series in November 1987. WWF management was still bitter over his impromptu sabbatical from his first WWF run, however, and he was not pushed or given any meaningful feuds. (Steamboat himself has implied in interviews that he was being punished for one-upping the Hogan-Andre main event at WrestleMania III.) After defeating Ravishing Rick Rude by disqualification at 1988 Royal Rumble, Steamboat was entered into the tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IV in March 1988. On WWF television prior to the match, Steamboat appeared in a vignette where he stated that he hoped Randy Savage would win his first round match, thus setting up a rematch of last year’s WrestleMania match and “one more classic confrontation”. However, Steamboat would lose to his first round opponent Greg “The Hammer” Valentine. Although television segments were shot immediately after WrestleMania IV that made it appear that Steamboat would be facing Valentine in a series of matches, Steamboat left the WWF shortly thereafter.</p><h3>Did Randy Savage really injure Ricky Steamboat?</h3><p><b>The calculating Savage attacked Steamboat after their IC title match on WWF Superstars in November 1986</b>. He leaped from the top turnbuckle with the ring bell in hand. Steamboat flailed around on the mat like a cod in a fisherman’s boat. His hands clutched his neck.</p><h3>Why did Ricky Steamboat retire?</h3><p>The Dragon was undefeated on television during his 1991 run and lost only one match, a house show bout against Skinner. <b>The day after his dark match loss</b>, Steamboat gave his notice to WWF management and then quit the company shortly thereafter.</p><h3>What was Ricky The Dragon Steamboat finishing move?</h3><p><b>Diving Crossbody</b> The great Ricky Steamboat won a lot of his matches with less than climactic moves.
