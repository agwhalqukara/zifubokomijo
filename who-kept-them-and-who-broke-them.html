When pressed by the media after his win, however, Donald Trump said that Clinton has “been through enough” and that he won’t pursue charges.</p><p>As much as Trump’s campaign promises have led people to criticize him and fear his looming presidency, history shows that he — like so many other presidents before him — will simply not be able to fulfill many of the promises he made on the campaign trail.</p><p>In fact, historian Joseph J. Ellis has stated that he can only think of two presidents who ran honest campaigns and actually delivered on all of their promises: George Washington and James K. Polk.</p><p>For better or worse, no one can accurately predict what will happen during Trump’s presidency. Here are seven more presidents who made campaign promises and subsequently broke them once in the White House.</p><h2>Thomas Jefferson on Curbing Executive Power</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95406 alt="Tj Wikimedia" width=900 height=615 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/TJ-Wikimedia.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95406 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>Thomas Jefferson built his 1800 presidential campaign on promises that he would reduce federal power and the national debt.</p><p>However, Jefferson broke practically all of those pledges in 1803 when he completed the Louisiana Purchase, a massive, 827,000 square-mile land grab that cost $15 million and which Jefferson himself worried was unconstitutional. According to an inflation calculator, that purchase would have cost $3,058,223,330 today — not exactly debt reduction.</p><h2>Lyndon B. Johnson on Vietnam</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95405 alt="Lbj Wikimedia" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LBJ-Wikimedia.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95405 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>During his 1964 presidential campaign run, Lyndon B. Johnson stated that “We are not about to send American boys 9 or 10 thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves.”</p><p>Less than a year into his presidency, and empowered by the “blank check” that the Gulf of Tonkin resolution provided him, Johnson instead elected to escalate the conflict in Vietnam, ordering a multi-stage bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an event known as “Operation Rolling Thunder,” and deploying combat troops soon after.</p><h2>George H.W. Bush on Taxes</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95404 alt="Hw Wikipedia" width=900 height=597 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HW-WIkipedia.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95404 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span></p><p>The most famous soundbite of the 1988 Republican National Convention came from the party’s nominee, George H.W. Bush, when he promised, “Read my lips: no new taxes.”</p><p>Two years into his presidency, however, Bush signed off on a budget amid high deficits that included, lo and behold, new taxes. While Bush attempted to make good on his soundbite, a Democratic-controlled Congress would not relent on its demands to increase taxes to help decrease federal deficits. Bush’s acquiescence would help cost him his bid for re-election in 1992.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxvsSsoJ2dnql6pK3MqZiin55ivbO7zKKqnqs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bang-energy-s-ceo-jack-owoc-business-executive-age-wife-house-trump-supporter-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bang Energys CEO Jack Owoc: Business Executive, Age, Wife, House, Trump Supporter, Net Worth!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ucla-routs-cal-state-bakersfield-but-cody-riley-injures-knee-in-season-opener.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UCLA routs Cal State Bakersfield, but Cody Riley injures knee in season opener</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
