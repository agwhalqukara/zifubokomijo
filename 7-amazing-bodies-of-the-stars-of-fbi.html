From Missy Peregrym's love for athletic roles to Alana de la Garza's trust in her creative process, these actors bring more than just their acting chops to the screen. Sela Ward's poolside laps, Zeeko Zaki's protein-powered transformation, Vedette Lim's desert hikes, and Ebonee Noel's technical dialogue mastery all contribute to their on-screen personas. Even Connie Nielsen's thoughtfully curated diet reflects her commitment to holistic well-being.

"The craziest part was just being kind of a different person every year. You get like 10 lbs. a year, I wanted to do it slow," Zaki explained. "But my biggest tip and the thing that I walked away from was a little trick I learned from </span><i><span>The 4-Hour Body</span></i><span> by Timothy Ferriss — 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.

"For breakfast, I eat organic food with high fat content, such as whole milk yogurt, nuts, seeds, fresh fruit and a scrambled egg. I cook it in organic grape seed oil for its high omega content. I drink a cappuccino for its dose of milk and the coffee for its taste, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
