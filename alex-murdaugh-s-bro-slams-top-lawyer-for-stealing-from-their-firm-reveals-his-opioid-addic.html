While I will support him in his recovery, I do not support, condone, or excuse his conduct in stealing by manipulating his most trusted relationships.</p><p>“I will continue to pursue my client’s interests with the highest degree of honesty and integrity, as I always have.”</p><p>His statement comes as South Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Don Beatty ordered Alex Murdaugh’s <a href=#>law license</a> to be suspended until further notice, starting Wednesday.</p><p>On Monday, Murdaugh, the legal dynasty heir whose wife and son were found murdered at their home in June, announced that he would be <a href=#>resigning from his family’s law firm</a> and entering rehab.</p><p>Later in the day, leaders of the Hampton, S.C., firm disclosed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> that Murdaugh was forced out after he was allegedly discovered to have misused money from the company.</p><p>It was also revealed that Murdaugh resigned from the law firm on Friday — just one day before the prominent lawyer suffered a “superficial head wound” from being shot.</p><p>Murdaugh told police he had been hit on a road in rural Hampton County, South Carolina on Saturday while changing a tire.</p><p>The 53-year-old lawyer worked as a partner at Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth and Detrick (PMPED), which was founded by his great-grandfather more than 100 years ago.</p><p>PMPED issued the following statement to various news outlets on Monday evening: “On Friday, September 3, 2021, Alex Murdaugh resigned from the Law Firm.</p><p>“He is no longer associated with PMPED in any manner. His resignation came after the discovery by PMPED that Alex misappropriated funds in violation of PMPED standards and policies.”</p><p>The statement continued: “A forensic accounting firm will be retained to conduct a thorough investigation. Law enforcement and the SC Bar have been notified by PMPED.</p><p>“This is disappointing news for all of us. Rest assured that our firm will deal with this in a straightforward manner.</p><p>“There’s no place in our firm for such behavior. Due to the ongoing investigations into these matters and client confidentiality, PMPED cannot comment further at this time.”</p><p>An unnamed source at the law firm said the amount of misused funds numbered in the millions.</p><p>In a Monday statement that did not address the shooting, Murdaugh said: “The murders of my wife and son have caused an incredibly difficult time in my life.</p><p>“I&nbsp;have made a lot of decisions that I truly regret.</p><p>“I’m resigning from my law firm and entering rehab after a long battle that has been exacerbated by these murders.</p><p>“I am immensely sorry to everyone I’ve hurt, including my family, friends and colleagues.</p><p>“I ask for prayers as I rehabilitate myself and my relationships.”</p><p>Murdaugh had been named a person of interest in the investigation into the June shooting death of his wife Maggie, 52, and 22-year-old son Paul, according to local reports at the time.</p><p>The Sun has contacted the S.C. Law Enforcement Division for the latest on that case. No arrests have been made in either case.</p><p>Alex, 53, was airlifted to a hospital in Savannah. A family spokesperson later told NBC2 that Murdaugh is expected to survive the shooting.</p><p>“The Murdaugh family has suffered through more than anyone family could ever imagine. We expect Alex to recover and ask for your privacy while he recovers,” the statement said.</p><h2>SHOT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD</h2><p>Murdaugh’s attorney Jim Griffin told the News Observer that his client had been on his way to Charleston hours before the shooting when he had car trouble and stopped.</p><p>Murdaugh <a href=#>had been changing a tire when a car passed him</a>, Griffin told ABC4. The vehicle then turned around and someone in the car shot him, he claimed.</p><p>The <a href=#>shooting of Murdaugh</a> comes exactly three months after he discovered his wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie, and his 22-year-old son, Paul</a>, shot to death at the family’s hunting lodge in Colleton County on June 7.</p><p>Their bodies were each found with multiple gunshot wounds yard apart from one another near the family’s dog kennel on the 1,700-acre property.</p><p>Investigators believe they were murdered with two different firearms.</p><h2>MOM AND SON KILLED</h2><p>Paul suffered a series of shotgun blasts to the chest, arm, and head, the early forensic analysis showed.</p><p>Meanwhile, 52-year-old Maggie appeared to have been killed with an assault rifle, investigators said.</p><p>A law enforcement source told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Island Packet</a>&nbsp;at the time that Paul was likely the target, while Margaret may have just been killed simply because she was at the home.</p><p>Alexander later discovered the pair dead. In <a href=#>a harrowing 911 call, he told an operator: “It’s my wife and son</a> … nobody’s breathing.”</p><p>At the time of his death, Paul had been&nbsp;<a href=#>awaiting trial on charges of boating under the influence</a>&nbsp;following a crash in February 2019 which resulted in the death of 19-year-old Mallory Beach.</p><h2>FATAL BOAT CRASH</h2><p>The University of South Carolina student was accused of crashing a 17-foot center console watercraft owned by his father into a bridge piling in Beaufort County.</p><p>It was allegedly he crashed the boat “full throttle” into the bridge after a drunken argument with friends on board.</p><p>All six passengers on board were flung from the vessel.</p><p>Beach’s body was recovered seven days after the fatal wreck.</p><p>Authorities have not yet said whether they definitively believe that the attack on the Murdaugh family is related to that incident.</p><p>Paul previously pleaded not guilty to a series of felony charges related to Beach’s death.</p><p>Alexander Murdaugh and other members of the family were also under investigation for obstruction of justice in the aftermath of the fatal crash.</p><h2>WELL CONNECTED</h2><p>For generations, the Murdaugh family has had deep ties to the Hampton County prosecutor’s office.</p><p>Murdaugh himself currently works part-time for the 14th Circuit solicitor’s office,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Post and Courier</a>.</p><p>The office was previously run by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, according to the outlet.</p><p>It was alleged by local media at the time that Paul was never given a sobriety test at the hospital in the wake of the crash because his father and uncle stopped it.</p><p>The teen was later released on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond after his not guilty plea in May 2019.</p><h2>MORE DEATHS LINKED TO FAMILY</h2><p>Two other mysterious deaths have also allegedly been linked back to the Murdaugh family in the wake of Maggie and Paul’s murders.</p><p>The South Carolina Highway Patrol received an anonymous tip connecting the Murdaugh family to the hit-and-run death of Stephen Smith back in 2015, the New York Post reports.</p><p>Stephen was found dead in the middle of a rural road outside of Hampton. The 19-year-old had his skull partially crushed and his shoulder dislocated.</p><p>Sandy and Todd Proctor, two former South Carolina Highway Patrol detectives who investigated Stephen’s death believe the well-to-do family had some involvement in the murder, but could not back up their claims with proof.</p><p>No one in the family was charged or ever considered a formal suspect.</p><p>A third death now being traced back to the Murdaughs was 57-year-old Gloria Satterfield who died as a result of a “trip and fall” accident, according to documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=#>FITSNews</a>.</p><p>Court documents don’t explain where Gloria died but local reports indicted she was a housekeeper for the Murdaughs – something also mentioned in her obituary.</p><p>Alex, Paul’s father, was said to have settled the wrongful death claim for $500,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000658216336-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000660469450.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000660469157.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Alex Murdaugh shot in head while changing tire on the side of the road</span></p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>We pay for your stories!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkaGyuXnMrqmdmaWctbR5waumZquclrq0edOop2akkazGpr6Mn6arZaOpsqK4yKeeZp6ipLpuwMeeoKtllp6%2FrnnRnq2emZyoeqm10mamqaGfnrFurcOdoJysmaS7bq3FrZyrZZaWuqq42Kxkpq2imbKzew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./geno-smith-national-football-league-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Geno Smith | National Football League, News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trevor-jackson-praises-lil-nas-x-following-his-sexual-orientation-revelation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trevor Jackson Praises Lil Nas X Following His Sexual Orientation Revelation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
