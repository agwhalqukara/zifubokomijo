However, he said Ziegler did not answer.</p><p>The Raiders have made Jones inactive for each of their first three games this season, opting to do so after he <a href=# rel=noopener>criticized the Raiders organization</a> and claimed he wasn't being allowed to workout at the team facility in a series of since-deleted social media posts earlier this month.</p><p>The Raiders have declined to say much regarding Jones' status to this point. Leading up to their season opener, Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels <a href=# rel=noopener>called it</a> a "personal situation and a private matter."<br></p><p>After making him inactive for the first two games of the season, the Raiders <a href=# rel=noopener>placed</a> Jones on the non-football illness (NFI) list prior to their Week 3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>No specifics have been given regarding what illness Jones may be dealing with, but as part of his tweet on Monday, Jones wrote: "I'm still confused on what I did wrong. I'm stuck here. I'm very sane. I'm [too] strong of a person to be mentally broken."</p><p>Jones signed a three-year, $51 million contract with the Raiders last year after splitting his first 10 NFL seasons between the New England Patriots and Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>In 15 games last season, Jones finished with only 4.5 sacks, which was a career low for him in a season in which he appeared in at least six games.</p><p>Jones has finished with double-digit sacks in a season seven times. He led the league with 17 sacks in 2017 and had a career-high 19 in 2019.</p><p>Jones has 112 sacks in 154 career games, which puts him 26th on the NFL's <a href=# rel=noopener>official career sacks list</a> and 37th on the unofficial list, which takes into account sacks before they became an official stat in 1982.</p><p>Without the two-time first-team All-Pro in the lineup, the Raiders are off to a 1-2 start this season. They will look to get back to .500 on Sunday when they go on the road to face the Los Angeles Chargers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWWGdnyMq5iinJWnwG6vx5qlnaSVp3qru82eqmarka7AbrTEZq6aq12dvLS8yK2YpaGqmrFurcaaoKerpGK6unnWoqOlZZKueq2t0matnp%2BRqHqnsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-east-net-worth-phone-number-house-address-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew East Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./porn-star-dahlia-sky-live-tributes-for-melissa-sims-hayes-after-suicide-following-cancer-as-j.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Porn star Dahlia Sky LIVE: Tributes for Melissa Sims Hayes after suicide following cancer as J</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
