The 68-year-old Sandusky was sentenced to at least 30 years and not more that 60 years in prison for his conviction in June on 45 counts of child sexual abuse, including while he was the defensive coordinator for the Penn State college football team.

It's too abstract, only a big number.</p><p>You are sentenced to spend not less than 30 and not more than 60 years in prison; that has the unmistakable impact of saying the rest of your life.</p><p>This can be an unsatisfying number, considering the fact that we're talking about dozens of convictions leveled at Sandusky, all for unspeakably heinous crimes. If that doesn't warrant over a century of sentencing, one might wonder, what would?</p><p>But justice isn't all about catering to the lizard brain. Yes, it's more satisfying in movies when the bad guy dies in an explosion instead of a single gunshot, for example. That's Hollywood.</p><p>Justice isn't Hollywood. Justice isn't about piling on "for good measure." Jerry Sandusky needs to die in prison and John Cleland just assured that he would.</p><p>And if a de facto death sentence for Jerry Sandusky isn't enough for you to feel OK with his punishment, that's OK, but eventually it just says more about you and your understanding of the courts than the courts themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGxuZGiEd3nJnqmrsV2orq%2Bw1KyismWjmru1sc2cnGZrYGKDcXnYnpirq12svK%2FAjKyYraGjm8ZurculZJutpGK2tb%2BMrKuipJxisaat06E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-depp-responds-to-amber-heard-s-drug-abuse-claims.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Depp Responds to Amber Heard's Drug Abuse Claims</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlos-vela-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carlos Vela Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
