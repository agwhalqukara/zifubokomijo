class=mol-para-with-font>But, it seems, there is rather more to it than that, as Wynne-Parker acknowledges when I suggest that he was, in fact, asked to resign by the club’s hierarchy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You could put it like that,’ he agrees. ‘It was the former Secretary, David Cowdery, who did it.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neither Cowdery, who retired this month, nor his successor, nor indeed anyone else at the club, cares to comment on Wynne-Parker’s departure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But I’m told that the Cavalry & Guards, which has intimate ties with the

threatens to imperil the Prince of Wales’s reputation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With Fawcett and William Bortrick, owner of society stud book Burke’s Peerage, Wynne-Parker discussed how best to

‘services to charities in the UK’ — donating more than £1.5 million to The Prince’s Foundation.

She’ll say, ‘I’m very surprised you haven’t taken the dog for a walk yet’. She is a bit of a controller. She runs a very tight ship and she’s brilliant at running a home.
