Or should I have known better?‚Äù</p><p>When asked about the events after her mother‚Äôs death, Wynonna recounted rushing to her home to visit her mother after her sister Ashley discovered the corpse. She added that she had said her goodbyes to her mother in the hospital and was unsure of what to do next.</p><p>Wynonna said that she feels her mother‚Äôs presence and also discussed her connection with Naomi, saying:</p><p>‚ÄúWe were so close, and then she‚Äôd get upset with me‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd disagree, get estranged, and then come back together to embrace and weep. It was quite difficult. We tried so hard, and those are my tears because I know we tried and did quite well. ‚ÄúThe majority of the time.‚Äù</p><p>She noted that a person loses a lot with the loss of their mother, despite the fact that all of these are past emotions. Wynonna went on to say that her mother once grabbed her hand in hers and told her that her life was better because of her and that those memories are now flooding back to her.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Mother Naomi and daughter Wynonna Judd were one of the most successful country music duos in history.
