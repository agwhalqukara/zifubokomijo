After a representative of Jax came out to say that the allegations made by Lance blindsided him, the former boybander is telling his side of the story.</p><p>Although Lance did the right thing by cutting ties with the reality star, he’s taking a lot of heat for being friends with him in the first place. Viewers will remember he stepped up to marry the couple after their pastor was exposed for being homophobic.</p><p>Fans wanted to know why he’d do such a thing with Jax’s history of being the villain and defending his pastor.</p><p>Bass opened up about all the drama on his podcast.</p><p>‘You wanna know what really went down? Look, I’m gonna preface this right now, because I know we have a lot of new listeners here. I do not think Jax Taylor is a racist or a homophobe, and I’ve said that millions of times. I would not be acquaintances with someone if I thought you were a racist and a homophobe. It just doesn’t make sense. The whole reason I married him and his wife last summer was I thought it was a great statement, because I was replacing their [homophobic] preacher. To me, that was a statement, and I thought it was big of them to make that statement.’</p><p>He went on to say that they went into business together because he wanted to show the world that Jax had changed; however, he saw that that wasn’t the situation when he watched the 40-year-old tweet up a storm during the episodes airing.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBCEbFZFqEd/</a></p><p>vand</p><p>He went on to explain: ‘I was happy to back him and believe in him, and I always want the best things for him — but then, this season started airing, and he reverted back to the same crap he was spewing. I obviously have not heard anything racist come out of his mouth. I mean, I hear of tweets. I’m still confused exactly, the exact tweets everyone’s pissed about. This is all I know: I never heard him say a racist thing, except the big nose thing recently.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jax has yet to respond to Bass’ rebuttal.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclruksYybmKyrXZi5or7In6Ceq12staLAjKGYqaiVo7KlecGeq7CdlaN6qbXMZpinnF2frrl505qwpaeiYrGmssSnm6xlmJ7AbrDEnKCsoZ%2BjerW7jKaYq6qpYsGixcuoqWaZnpl6o77IrauapqlisKK%2B07Cpop%2BYqXp1fJZsb21n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rare-17th-century-gold-coins-discovered-in-walls-of-a-french-mansion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rare 17th-Century Gold Coins Discovered In Walls Of A French Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./explore-mescal-wasilewski-wiki-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Explore Mescal Wasilewski Wiki Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
