Initially, Young sat on the sidelines watching Joe Montana and learning the Bill Walsh system.</p><p>When Young first got the chance to play, due to a Montana injury, he was often criticized, even by his own offensive lineman.&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling was that&nbsp;he scrambled too much and the linemen&nbsp;didn't know where he'd be, so it was difficult to provide proper protection.</p><p>Following two year stints in the USFL and with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Steve Young joined the 49ers in 1987.&nbsp; His career spanned&nbsp;13 years in San Francisco and played his last game in 1999.</p><p>From 1987-1990, Steve Young played sporadically, relieving Joe Montana when injuries shelved the 49er starter.&nbsp; Due to an arm injury to Montana, Young started the majority of the&nbsp;1991 season, but he too went down with an injury in the ninth game.&nbsp; Steve Bono played well in his absence and Young would not return until the 15th game, when Bono was injured.</p><p>The 49ers missed the playoffs in 1991 for the first time since the 1981 season.&nbsp; Steve Young was the quarterback in 1992, as Joe Montana's injured arm was slow to recover.&nbsp; Young led the Niners to the NFC championship game, a loss to the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Prior to the start of the 1993 season, Joe Montana was traded and the 49er offense was in Young's capable hands for the next seven years.&nbsp; Young learned how to be an effective pocket passer and also utilized his tremendous running ability more judiciously.&nbsp;</p><p>As Steve Young continued to gain more command of the 49er offense, he became an elite quarterback in the league.&nbsp; In the 1994 season, Young guided the 49ers to victory in Super Bowl XXIX, over San Diego.&nbsp; He was named Super Bowl MVP, as he became the first player to lead his team in passing and rushing in a Super Bowl.</p><p>Steve Young enjoyed a tremendous career with the 49ers.&nbsp; He started 124 games for San Francisco and compiled a record of 91-33.&nbsp; He was on three Super Bowl championship teams, but two of those were as a back up to Joe Montana.&nbsp; Young's crowning achievement came in that Super Bowl XXIX victory.</p><p>As a 49er, Steve Young threw for 29,907 yards, on 2,400 completions in 3,648 attempts, a 65.8% mark.&nbsp; Young's yards per attempt of 8.2 was also&nbsp;extremely high.&nbsp; He threw 221 touchdown passes and had only 86 interceptions.</p><p>During his time with the 49ers, Steve Young was also a prolific runner.&nbsp; He ran for 3,581 yards and had 37 rushing touchdowns.&nbsp; As I noted earlier, it was when he actually became a better pocket passer and chose his spots to run, did Young become a superstar.</p><p>Steve Young was a seven time Pro Bowl and six time All-Pro selection.&nbsp; He was also the NFL's MVP in both 1992 and 1994.</p><p>Steve Young was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005 and his number 8 is retired by the 49ers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobGppZW6Dbr%2FAp2SfqpGjsKq%2FwqhkbXGVp8BuwM6pZK2dnmK%2Btq3RrZyrmpGYuLR5zp9kmqScYsGqucQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blink-or-flinch-for-example.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blink or flinch for example</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./product-used-to-change-hair-color.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Product used to change hair color</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
