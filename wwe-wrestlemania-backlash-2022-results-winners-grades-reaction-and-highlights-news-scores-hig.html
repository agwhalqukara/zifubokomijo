The crowd was hot and chanting before they even made contact. Uso backed Orton to the corner and hit a few punches before The Legend Killer poked him in the eye and brought in Riddle for a double-team.&nbsp;</p><p>When McIntyre tagged in, he threw Jimmy to the corner and told him to tag in Reigns. Paul Heyman advised against it, but The Tribal Chief decided to listen to the crowd and got in the ring. Then he tagged in Jey and told the crowd he was the shot-caller and would do things his way.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn't decide to get involved until Riddle was down in The Bloodline's corner. Reigns and McIntyre finally ended up being the legal men at the same time. After a little trash-talking, they started throwing hands.&nbsp;</p><p>The Viper came in off the hot tag and began to run through everyone. He caught Reigns with an RKO out of nowhere before dropping Jimmy with another. Jey barely managed to break up the pin.&nbsp;</p><p>As the match progressed, the ref began to lose control. Everybody was fighting in and around the ring. Reigns put McIntyre through the announce table with an urinagi, while Riddle took out Jey with an RKO from the top rope before The Tribal Chief cut him in half with a Spear to score the win.</p><p>This was another example of an entertaining match that was far better than the story behind it. Everybody looked great in this one. Even without any titles on the line, this still felt like a bout that was worthy of closing the event.&nbsp;</p><p>As a whole, WrestleMania Backlash will be remembered as a show with some really solid wrestling but little in the way of storyline development for anyone involved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grade:&nbsp;</strong>A-</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Notable Moments and Observations</strong></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Before this match took place, Kayla Braxton reported that Charlotte suffered a broken radius during her match with Rousey. Whether this is real or part of a storyline isn't clear at this point.&nbsp;</li><li>Reigns trolling the crowd was as funny as it was predictable.&nbsp;</li><li>The Tribal Chief&nbsp; had some new boots with red accents. They really stood out against his black gear.&nbsp;</li><li>Jey took out Orton on the apron with a superkick at one point, and the way The Viper sold it was hilarious. He just sort of collapsed to the apron and slowly fell off it to the floor.&nbsp;</li><li>At one point, Reigns decked Riddle to knock him off the apron and commentator Pat McAfee laughed like a little kid. It was hilarious.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXJtZmWBcXnWsJxmr6KawLW4xKaYp6GRYq%2Bir8qlmKygXWd9c36Mq5ysrZypwG7DyKelnqqjYrSzrcOeqmaqlZawtbXOp2SappRitaqzx6WgoKCkqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apt-name-for-an-angler-crossword-puzzles-nyt-clue.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Apt name for an angler Crossword Puzzles NYT Clue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emergency-veterinarian-clarksville-tn-in-clarksville-tn-for-clarksville-veterinary-emergency-s.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emergency Veterinarian - Clarksville, TN in Clarksville, TN for Clarksville Veterinary Emergency &amp;amp; S</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./4-000-year-old-temple-and-monolith-discovered-in-cyprus.html>4,000-Year-Old Temple And Monolith Discovered In Cyprus</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grove-co-it-s-so-good-i-can-t-live-without-it.html>Grove Co.It's So Good I Can't Live Without It</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaitlyn-bristowe-shawn-booth-went-undercover-pre-finale-photo.html>Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth Went Undercover Pre-Finale: Photo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./151-birthday-wishes-for-daughter-to-make-her-day-memorable.html>151 Birthday Wishes for Daughter to make her day memorable.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-peach-rings-sour-celebrity-fm-1-official-stars-business-people-network-wiki-succe.html>Are peach rings sour?
